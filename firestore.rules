/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the VectorZen game settings.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows any authenticated user to read and write game settings.
 * This is based on the assumption that all authenticated users should be able to modify these settings.
 * If more granular control is required, a role-based access control system (e.g., an admin role) should be implemented.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All game settings are stored in a single top-level collection: `/gameSettings/{gameSettingsId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Allows any authenticated user to read and write game settings.
 * - Does not implement role-based access control.
 * - Assumes a homogeneous security posture across all documents within the `gameSettings` collection.
 * - Authorization independence: No reliance on external documents for authorization.
