# **App Name**: VectorZen

## Core Features:

- Number to Ball Conversion: Dynamically convert positive and negative numbers into red and blue balls, respectively, to represent the equation visually.
- Ball Pairing: Enable users to pair positive and negative balls to visually cancel out and simplify the equation.
- Equation Solver: Solve math equations automatically based on number of remaining blue/red balls

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke focus and intelligence.
- Background color: Very Light Gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, non-distracting background.
- Accent color: Vibrant Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and important information, drawing user's eye to them.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, minimalist vector icons to represent numbers and actions. Positive values will have red, circular outlined icons; negative values will have blue, square outlined icons.
- Implement a clean, centered layout with ample spacing to avoid clutter and provide clarity. Prioritize ease of use for the math game concept.
- Use subtle transition animations for adding and pairing balls. Employ scaling and fade effects to draw focus to important actions or changes. Enhance haptic feedback on successful pairings for better UI feeling.
